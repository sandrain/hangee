# NOTE
This is an achieve of my old personal project, a PHP/MySQL based web program that helps to memorize GRE vocabulary.
VERY out-dated that the last time this was tested was sometime in 2012. Not tested.

# hangee
GRE word memorizing web program (PHP/MySQL).

All server-side were written in PHP (don't even remember the version), client-side in asynchronous javascript (ajax).
Some fancy features are:

- frequently appearing GRE words, at that time (2010-2011)
- built-in etymology and collins cobuild dictionary (stardic file)
- multi-user support, although not complete (authentication/session)
- multiple study modes
- star/mark for browsing/studying words selectively (multiple stars are possible: e.g. listing only 3-star words)
- keyboard shortcuts for all navigation
- also, tablet (touch) friendly
- the 'm' directory holds full-featured mobile version for smartphones (using browser database for storing session)
- light-weight, mostly text/css without heavily using images

Maybe some features might be useful to someone, though it is too old?
At least, the database files (in /handata directory) can be useful.
